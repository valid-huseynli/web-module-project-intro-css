             <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, 
            the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.
            </p>
            <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand meadows, 
            ancient giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>
